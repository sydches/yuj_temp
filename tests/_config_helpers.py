"""Shared test config factory — single source of truth for Config defaults.

Each test file used to inline ~50 Config field defaults in its own
``make_config``. When Config grew a new required field, every test
file had to be updated — drift-prone. This module holds one canonical
default dict; callers get a Config instance via ``make_config(**overrides)``.

Usage from any test module (after the sys.path shim is in place):

    from _config_helpers import make_config
    cfg = make_config(max_turns=10, duplicate_abort=3)
