"""CompoundContext — narrative memory + persistent state, merged.

Combines the reasoning-preservation of YujTranscript with the cross-session
persistence of SolverStateContext. Reads state from `.solver/state.json`
(harness-written, cross-session) AND renders each trace entry with the
model's own pre-tool reasoning when available.

Named for the commandments.md Memory section:

    "the file is the compound effect of your past actions across sessions;
     read it to see where you are"

Design principles:

  - Source of truth: `.solver/state.json`, projected from `.trace.jsonl` by
    state_writer. Survives session boundaries. Model never maintains it.
  - Narrative trace: each entry includes reasoning (model's pre-tool
    sentence) in addition to action/result/next. Reasoning is deduplicated
    by (session, turn) — multi-tool turns render it once.
  - Content-blind: the harness never inspects tool results for task-format
    patterns. The evidence `verdict` field is OK/FAIL, derived by
    `classify_outcome` from harness-generated exit-code markers only.
    Fail-first ordering and the gate pointer both key off that field, not
    off content parsing.
  - Evidence ordering: FAIL entries first (the Friction signal), then pass
    entries if budget remains. Gate pointer = most recent FAIL, rendered at
    the top of the user message so the model sees what's blocking before
    scanning the full trace.
  - Rolling tool-result window: identical to parent. Raw tool output only —
    reasoning text never enters the rolling window.

Supersedes YujTranscript (narrative-only) and the base SolverStateContext
(stub-only trace) by taking the better half of each.
