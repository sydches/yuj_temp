"""Savings ledger — token-accounting for harness transforms.

Writes ``<task_cwd>/.savings.jsonl`` as one JSON record per transform
event. Records input/output char counts, computes the delta, tags
each event as ``exact`` (both sides observed) or ``estimate`` (one
side inferred from a calibration multiplier). Aggregated post-run by
``analysis/savings_summary.py``.

Always on. No config gate — Bucket A observability infrastructure.
See ``docs/token_savings.md`` for the bucket taxonomy and accounting
discipline (exact vs. estimate, baseline semantics, what claims the
ledger supports).

The module-level singleton is justified by the harness's single-
process-per-task execution model: ``solve_task`` opens a ledger at
the start of a task and closes it at the end. ``Session`` sets the
current ``(session, turn)`` on the ledger at the top of each turn,
so downstream transforms call ``get_ledger().record(...)`` without
threading a reference through dispatch / tool / context call stacks.

Sign convention for ``delta_chars``:
  negative  → tokens saved (output smaller than input)
  positive  → tokens paid (one-time costs like system prompt)
  zero      → no-op (recorded for auditing completeness)
